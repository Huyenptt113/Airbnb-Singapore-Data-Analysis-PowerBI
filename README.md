# An analysis based on Airbnb Singapore market data
# Problem & motivation:
* Nowadays, the dominance of the Internet and booking platforms is growing year by year since more and more tourists book their hotels online. Airbnb is a booking platform for listing and renting local homes. The idea of this project came from the love of traveling and the hope to find insights that might be helpful for future tourists when it comes to looking for an ideal place to stay during a vacation in Singapore.
* This project mainly focused on the top 5 districts with the most listings in Airbnb Singapore: Kallang, Geylang, Downtown Core, Outram, and Rochor.
* The target audiences that the project toward to are: Tourists who want to visit Singapore.

# Dataset:
* The data was sourced from the Inside Airbnb website http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. The raw dataset of the project is the detailed listing data under the Singapore area, which comprises 3672 listings. The dataset has been updated since 26th December 2021.

# Aim of study:
* This project aims to answer the question: Which location is the best to stay among Airbnb Singapore's top 5 most rentals districts? Comparing these 5 locations was based on various aspects of a listing such as Capacity and Room type, Host information and Communication, Rating scores, and Prices.

# Project Outline:
* This project includes several steps from collecting data, pre-processing, analyzing, and presenting final insights on the PowerBI dashboard.
* Data pre-processing steps were applied to the raw dataset:
1. Removing unwanted data and Creating new columns
2. Checking duplicated and corrupted data
3. Changing data type and dealing with missing data
4. Detecting outliers

# Recommendations
* Kallang would be the best location to stay in Singapore for low-budget (both solo and group) travelers in terms of affordable prices, capacity, vast listing choices, and instantly bookable options.
* Downtown Core seems to be more suitable for tourists who are not too price-sensitive and have higher requirements for location and services.

# Limitations and Future Work:
* Due to the lack of information and the small size of the dataset, this report is limited in scope.
* The dataset was not up to date, and multiple missing values in the data hindered the accuracy of the analysis.
* These recommendations are only suitable for solo and small groups of travelers with less than six people.
* In future research, this project should be improved by increasing the number of data points using an updated dataset and analyzing more aspects, such as amenities.
